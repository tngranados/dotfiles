# tngranados dotfiles

Clone repository and use make for further instructions.

```
git clone https://github.com/tngranados/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make
```

If not cloned in `~./dotfiles` you need to setup a `$DOTFILES` variable with its path.

You can include your own zsh files in `$DOTFILES/local/zsh` and they will be loaded automatically.
